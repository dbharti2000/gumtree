Scenario Details -

- I've developed the cucumber scenario, which covers all the acceptance
criteria which have been mentioned in task 1.
- However google provides different results most of times, i've made the test
robust so that it can handles any number of gumtree results on google page
 e.g 0 or 5 gumtree results
- Test clicks on all gumtree links and validates that title has been displayed on gumtree website
- Test validates that number of results shown at gumtree site are more than 0
